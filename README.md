# Blog-Post-Manager
This project is a blog post management system built with React and TypeScript, designed to fetch and display posts from an API. It demonstrates API handling, state management using hooks, and responsive UI design with CSS and SCSS. Key components include a post listing, post detail view, and category filtering, all integrated with an external data source from a mock API. 

The application highlights my skills in frontend development, including efficient data fetching, TypeScript type safety, and a clean, user-friendly interface.
